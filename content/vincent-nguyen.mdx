Hello World!

My name is Vincent Nguyen, and I was born and raised in Saigon, Vietnam, although I've spent most of my life thus far in Fredericton, New Brunswick.

Growing up, I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do with my life. 
I wasn't particularly fond of anything, I wasn't the best at school, nor was I good at sports, or anything that my parents were making me do.
I was spending my childhood mostly just biking around town, playing music, and hanging out with my friends.

Unlike most of the kids I went to school with, I didn't have a specific "niche" that I was 1) Good at, like _decently_ good at, or at least 2) Somewhat interested in.

However, often when I try to reflect on my childhood, I'd always remember this one person who I looked up to a lot, like, a lot a _lot_, and it's my cousin Huỳnh.

I vaguely remember him working as an Electrical Engineer for mid-sized tech company based in Saigon.
And looking back at it now, he was one hell of a hard worker, even during our trips back to Vietnam, he'd often stay at his company's office way past 1 AM.
Grinding it all out, just because he loves his job so much.

I was definitely not the most social kid you would've known back then. 
I was shy, awkward, quiet, and spent most of my elementary school days grinding out and climbing ranks on a mobile game called Pixel Gun 3D (RIP Pixel Gun).

Though, a large portion of my childhood was also spent doing a bunch of cool stuff with Huỳnh, whether it be building a remote-controlled car from Arduino servomotors and wooden planks
he picked up just right on the side of the road, or just racing with each other on bikes. Life was pretty simple back then.

As time went on, I kind of realized, wow, building stuff was actually pretty cool. So we kept on building, and building, and building.
It was genuinely pretty fun and rewarding just to kind of make stuff on the go and let my brain go into its own world, often wandering off about all the things we could do. 

There was a quote that goes something along the lines of:

> “You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.”

> Jim Rohn 

I just agree with it so much. I kind of just internalized Huỳnh's personality without realizing it, just because I've spent time building cool stuff with him than everybody else that I knew of.
And it's shaped me into the person who I am today.

I feel like in a lot of ways, building things is like a form of art, you can become so creative with it, that the sky's the limit. 
Fast forward to 2025, more than a decade after my family has started to establish our lives in Canada, 
I still have fond memories of Huỳnh and our times hanging out together.

Sometimes, I couldn't help but think about how his passion and personality just infused my love for building stuff, and shaped the Vincent you know of today, even after not having seen each other in almost 3.5 years, as of writing this blog.
And I often wonder, who would I have become, if I'd never met Huỳnh at all.

And yeah, that is how I ended up today, right here, right now, as of writing this long a** essay, at the University of Waterloo in Waterloo, Ontario. 
And even though it's definitely been hella hard at times, this is still where I can see myself not just surviving, but thriving, doing the things I love - as a tribute to Huỳnh.
