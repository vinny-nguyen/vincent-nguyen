## An Introduction
Hello! Bonjour! Xin Chào!

My name is Vincent Nguyễn, born and raised in Saigon, Vietnam, although I've spent most of my life thus far in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada.

Growing up, I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do with my life. 
I wasn't particularly fond of anything, I wasn't the best at school, nor was I good at sports, or anything that my parents were making me do.
I was spending my childhood mostly just biking around town, playing music, and hanging out with my friends.

Unlike most of the kids I went to school with, I didn't have a specific "niche" that I 1) Was good at, like _decently_ good at, or 2) Was somewhat interested in.

However, often when I try to reflect on my childhood, I'd always remember this one exact person who I looked up to a lot, like a lot a _lot_ - my cousin Huỳnh.

I vaguely remember he was an Electrical Engineer at a mid-sized company based in Saigon. And man, he's always working very hard, oftentimes staying at his company's office way past 1 AM.
Just grinding it all out.

A large portion of my childhood was spent doing cool stuff with Huỳnh, whether it be building a remote-controlled car from wooden planks
he picked up from Marketplace for about 50 cents each, or just racing with each other on bikes.
